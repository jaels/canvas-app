## Welcome to the drawing app!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### To start the app

Please run `num install` and then `npm start`.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### More remarks

- In general - the combination of Typescript-Hooks-Redux is not something I've worked much with before. I've used hooks, but mostly in a local state and redux mostly combined with flow. I've written a few small apps with typescript. So I can imagine that there are better ways and practices to write some stuff. But don't worry I'm happy to learn and improve...
- I used `@ts-ignore` twice because I didn't have time to figure out what typescript wants me to do. I also probably used the `any` type more than I should've, from the same reason.
- The statistics doesn't work on colors from imported files and from a refreshed page. I almost solved the latter but had some parsing problems with the localStorage and ran out of time (there might be some leftover code from this effort).
- In general, of course, it doesn't work perfectly, and the code could be probably better organised, but this is what I achieved in the time frame.

## Enjoy!!!
